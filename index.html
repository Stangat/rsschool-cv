          <p>
            I gratuated from "Francisk Skorina Gomel State University" as an
            electronics engineer back in 2005. The specialization of my faculty
            was medical electronics, so it was no surprise that I found my job
            at one of the biggest medical state institutions called "Republican
            Scientific and Practical Center for Radiation Medicine and Human
            Ecology" as an engineer maintaining and repairing medical equipment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since that time I gradually and constantly evolved as a
            specialist, building perfect relationships with my colleagues
            what eventually made me senior engineer at my department.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm very curious and hardworking person and probably owing to
            these qualities I always aspire for something new, and maybe
            because of it I have tried programming recently. I was very keen
            on Frontend Web Development because I liked the visual side of
            it and immediate result you get after trying something out.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know how to manage my time and it really helps a lot in
            learning process, besides there is a great amount of educational
            information all around the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope that sooner or later I become a really good front-end
            specialist.
