### **About myself:**
I gratuated from "Francisk Skorina Gomel State University" as an engineer-physicist back in 2005. The specialization of my faculty was medical electronics, so it was no surprise that I found my job at one of the biggest medical state institutions called "Republican Scientific and Practical Center for Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology" as an engineer maintaining and repairing medical equipment.

Since that time I gradually and constantly evolved as a specialist, building perfect relationships with my colleagues what eventually made me senior engineer at my department.

I'm very curious and hardworking person and probably owing to these qualities I always aspire for something new, and maybe because of it I have tried programming recently. I was very interested on Frontend Development because I liked the visual side of it and immediate result you can get after trying something out.

I know how to manage my time and it really helps a lot in learning process, besides there is a great amount of educational information all around the internet. 

I hope that sooner or later I become a really good front-end specialist.
